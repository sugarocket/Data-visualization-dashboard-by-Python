 Developing Data visualization dashboard by using Python
## Story:
As a data analyst, I have been given a task to monitor and report US domestic airline flights performance. Goal is to analyze the performance of the reporting airline to improve flight reliability thereby improving customer reliability.

Below are the key report items,

Yearly airline performance report 
Yearly average flight delay statistics 
NOTE: Year range is between 2005 and 2020.
## Components of the report items
### 1. Yearly airline performance report
For the chosen year provide,
* Number of flights under different cancellation categories using bar chart.
* Average flight time by reporting airline using line chart.
* Percentage of diverted airport landings per reporting airline using pie chart.
* Number of flights flying from each state using choropleth map.
* Number of flights flying to each state from each reporting airline using treemap chart.


### 2. Yearly average flight delay statistics
For the chosen year provide,
* Monthly average carrier delay by reporting airline for the given year.
* Monthly average weather delay by reporting airline for the given year.
* Monthly average national air system delay by reporting airline for the given year.
* Monthly average security delay by reporting airline for the given year.
* Monthly average late aircraft delay by reporting airline for the given year.
## Resource:
* Copy and paste the below command in the terminal to download the skeleton:
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%205/5_Peer_Graded_Assignment_Questions.py

* Open 5_Peer_Graded_Assignment_Questions.py

## Run the Application:
* Firstly, install packaging, pandas and dash using the following command:
1. python3 -m pip install packaging
2. python3 -m pip install pandas dash

* Run the python file using the command:

python3 5_Peer_Graded_Assignment_Questions.py

* Observe the port number shown in the terminal and open in brower
